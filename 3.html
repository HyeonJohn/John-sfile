<p> This page talks about my adolescence. My adolescence was, I can say, very special indeed! I started to feel my very strong desire for success and the realization of my aspirations.
    Especially, escaping from being a copycat of my dad, I decided to be a businessman on my own. It was a huge step in my life to set my goal along with my flairs and dispositions.
    I can say this was the most important phase of my life. I realized that school can't teach me anything truly beneficial, so I decided to drop out of my school, and learn more about myself objectively and accurately.
    I exposed myself to many different situations where I could fully utilize my potential strenghts. While doing so, I could also reveal my weaknesses that I hadn't recognized. Spending time alone out of school taught me so many good things, which was a huge opportunity to love myself even more.</p>
