<p>This page talks about <b>my early childhood</b>. My childhood was very normal and boring. I was just a calm, introverted and overly mom-dependent child. To be honest, I have no idea how I was, and what kind of thoughts I had as a child as much time has been passed.
    But I can just say that I was just normal compared to how I am now, and didn't have much aspiration for the future and just wanted to pursue the same job as my dad. what a boring, typical child I used to be!</p>
